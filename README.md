## What I Learned

### List
1. Servers and Functions of MySQL

I had to create multiple servers and functions in order to interact with the MySQL workbench. For instance, getting, adding, and updating the tables.

2. Async/Await

Async/await was very useful when running code that involved MySQL and the inquirer. Many instances, I had to answer the questions before shifting over to the functions of MySQL.

3. Exporting Arrays

I had to retrieve items from the table, exporting them into my inquirer.js, and placing them into the choices for one of my questions. However, I was unable to do this.

4. Scope

I am still getting use to exporting objects and using them in the file I imported them to. However, I am getting more used to it.
